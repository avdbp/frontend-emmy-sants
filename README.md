# Emmy Sants E-Commerce Website

This project has been developed by Ana Gabriela Medina and Alejandro van den Bussche, two passionate web developers with a deep commitment to excellence. Our project represents a fully functional e-commerce platform for the "Emmy Sants" florist, located in the beautiful city of Barcelona. It's a MERN Stack application, check the backend repository [here](https://github.com/avdbp/backend-emmy-sants).

## About

Our project is centered around the development of an e-commerce platform for a florist specializing in the sale of plants and bouquets. This platform is not only designed to provide buyers with a convenient shopping experience but also offers a comprehensive control panel for the florist owner.

### Owner's Control Panel

We've implemented a robust and user-friendly control panel for the florist owner. From this panel, she can manage all aspects of her online business:

- **Product Management**: Easily add new products, update details like name, description, price, and stock, and remove products that are no longer available.

- **Order Management**: Review all received orders, mark them as delivered, and maintain a record of past orders.

- **Stock Control**: Keep product stock up-to-date, ensuring accurate product availability at all times.

- **Image Management**: Simplify product image uploads using the Cloudinary library, ensuring visually appealing product presentation on the website.

- **Secure Authentication**: We provide a secure authentication system, allowing the owner to log into her control panel privately and securely.
